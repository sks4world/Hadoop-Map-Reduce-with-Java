1. Login to Cloudera /home/admin/workspace
2. Transfer attached files to that folder. Rename the file using command mv UVCount.java UVoteCount.java
3. export JAVA_HOME = /usr/lib/java
4 export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar

7. Move the text files to a new folder using the command below
hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal file0*.txt /user/cloudera/input
8. Run the Java Mapper and Reducer Program on hadoop using the following command
hadoop jar UVoteCount.jar UVoteCount /user/cloudera/input /user/cloudera/ouptut
This will map both the input files, count the votes for each candidate and create one output file in output folder
9. View the input or output files using the command below
hdfs dfs -cat /user/cloudera/output/part-r-00000
